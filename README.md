# DevOps: Lab Agile Planning
_This Repository contains the lab for Agile Planning_

This repository is a collection of hands-on exercises and labs I used to learn and practice Cloud and DevOps concepts. It was created as a learning resource repo while studying Cloud and DevOps through IBM, but it's open to anyone who wants to explore these exciting fields.
**Let's Grow Together**

I created this Repository only for _learning purposes_ so I have not taken a **license** for it...
