# DevOps: Lab Agile Planning
_This Repository contains the lab for Agile Planning_

This repository is a collection of hands-on exercises and labs I used to learn and practice Cloud and DevOps concepts. It was created as a learning resource repo while studying Cloud and DevOps through IBM, but it's open to anyone who wants to explore these exciting fields.
**Let's Grow Together**

I created this Repository only for _learning purposes_ so I have not taken a **license** for it...

## Before dive into this lab, let's define a basic scenario for our example.

Scenario:

    We have a small development team working on a project.
    We're using a simple Agile methodology (e.g., Scrum) for planning and execution.
    The .xlsx file will contain a basic product backlog.
    The .py file will calculate the total story points for the backlog.

Creating the .xlsx File (Product Backlog)

File Name: product_backlog.xlsx

This file will contain a simple table with columns for:

    Story ID
    Story Description
    Story Points
    Priority
